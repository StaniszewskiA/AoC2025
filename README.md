- Day 05 [`day05.c`](src/day05.c):
    - Part 1: Count how many available ingredient IDs are fresh by checking if they fall within any of the given fresh ID ranges.

- Day 08 [`day08.c`](src/day08.c):
    - Part 1: Connect the closest pairs of junction boxes in 3D space, track circuit sizes, and multiply the sizes of the three largest circuits after a set number of connections.
